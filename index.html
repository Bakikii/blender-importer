<p>The visualization and exploration of neuroimaging data is
important for the analysis of anatomical and functional images and
statistical parametric maps. While two-dimensional orthogonal views of
neuroimaging data are used to display activity and statistical analysis,
real three-dimensional (3d) depictions are helpful for showing the spatial
distribution of a functional network, as well as its temporal evolution.
For our best knowledge, currently there is no neuroimaging 3d tool which
can visualize both MEG, fMRI and invasive electrodes (ECOG, depth
electrodes, DBS,  etc.). Here we present the multi-modality
visualization tool (MMVT). The tool was built for researchers who wish to
have a better understanding of their neuroimaging anatomical and functional
data. The true power of the tool is by visualizing and analyzing data from
multi-modalities. MMVT is built as two separated modules: The first is
implemented as an add-on in 'Blender‚Äù, an open-source 3d visualization
software. The add-on is an interactive graphic interface which enable to
visualize functional and statistical data (MEG and/or fMRI) on the cortex
and subcortical surfaces, invasive electrodes activity and so on. The tool
can also be used for a better 3d visualization of the anatomical data and
the invasive electrodes locations. The other module is a standalone
software, for importing and preprocessing. The users can select the data
they want to import to Blender and how they want to process it. The module
support many types of analyzed data, like FsFast (FreeSurfer Functional
Analysis Stream) and SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) for fMRI, MNE (a
software package for processing MEG and EEG) raw data for MEG and
FieldTrip (MATLAB software toolbox for neuroimaging analysis) data
structures for the invasive electrodes. The users can also reprocess raw
data using a wrappers for FaFast and mne-python (a python package for
sensor and source-space analysis of MEG and EEG data).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a3fo0sGuff7CadYNbh06Xrx4whcebrPo7K2xxXGpqA4/edit?usp=sharing">Linux installtion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uUCgElXcY884qb-vZ4EZGqLPbRWZH7ni6qVPQbkwXn8/edit?usp=sharing">Windows installtion</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After the installation, you'll enter the yet-not-documented territory. please contact me: <a href="mailto:npeled@mgh.harvard.edu">npeled@mgh.harvard.edu</a></p>

<p>The tool itself, can run on windows, mac and linux. If you want to connect it to freeview, you'll need to run it only on freesurfer compatible os, meaning linux and mac.
Also in the preprocessing tool there are few call to freesurfer, so mainly to create the anatomy files you'll need a os with freesurfer.
Beside of that, you can use the tool also on windows.</p>
