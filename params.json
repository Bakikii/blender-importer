While two-dimensional orthogonal views of\r\nneuroimaging data are used to display activity and statistical analysis,\r\nreal three-dimensional (3d) depictions are helpful for showing the spatial\r\ndistribution of a functional network, as well as its temporal evolution.\r\nFor our best knowledge, currently there is no neuroimaging 3d tool which\r\ncan visualize both MEG, fMRI and invasive electrodes (ECOG, depth\r\nelectrodes, DBS,  etc.). Here we present the multi-modality\r\nvisualization tool (MMVT). The tool was built for researchers who wish to\r\nhave a better understanding of their neuroimaging anatomical and functional\r\ndata. The true power of the tool is by visualizing and analyzing data from\r\nmulti-modalities. MMVT is built as two separated modules: The first is\r\nimplemented as an add-on in 'Blender‚Äù, an open-source 3d visualization\r\nsoftware. The add-on is an interactive graphic interface which enable to\r\nvisualize functional and statistical data (MEG and/or fMRI) on the cortex\r\nand subcortical surfaces, invasive electrodes activity and so on. The tool\r\ncan also be used for a better 3d visualization of the anatomical data and\r\nthe invasive electrodes locations. The other module is a standalone\r\nsoftware, for importing and preprocessing. The users can select the data\r\nthey want to import to Blender and how they want to process it. The module\r\nsupport many types of analyzed data, like FsFast (FreeSurfer Functional\r\nAnalysis Stream) and SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) for fMRI, MNE (a\r\nsoftware package for processing MEG and EEG) raw data for MEG and\r\nFieldTrip (MATLAB software toolbox for neuroimaging analysis) data\r\nstructures for the invasive electrodes. The users can also reprocess raw\r\ndata using a wrappers for FaFast and mne-python (a python package for\r\nsensor and source-space analysis of MEG and EEG data).\r\n\r\n## Videos\r\n\r\n![Example](resources/MEG-ttest.gif \"spatial and temporal ttest result of MEG activation\")\r\n![Example](resources/meg-electrodes-coherence.gif \"MEG & Electrodes & Coherence\")\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n- [Linux installtion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a3fo0sGuff7CadYNbh06Xrx4whcebrPo7K2xxXGpqA4/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Windows installtion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uUCgElXcY884qb-vZ4EZGqLPbRWZH7ni6qVPQbkwXn8/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nAfter the installation, you'll enter the yet-not-documented territory. please contact me: npeled@mgh.harvard.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tool itself, can run on windows, mac and linux. If you want to connect it to freeview, you'll need to run it only on freesurfer compatible os, meaning linux and mac.\r\nAlso in the preprocessing tool there are few call to freesurfer, so mainly to create the anatomy files you'll need a os with freesurfer.\r\nBeside of that, you can use the tool also on windows.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n- Ohad Felsenstein (ohadfel@gmail.com)\r\n- Noam Peled (npeled@mgh.harvard.edu)\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\nThis tool is being developed as part of the [Transform DBS project](https://transformdbs.partners.org/).\r\nIt's sponsored by:\r\n- The U.S. Army Research Office and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-14-2-0045. \r\n- The NCRR (S10RR014978) and NIH (S10RR031599,R01-NS069696, 5R01-NS060918, U01MH093765)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\nMMVT is **BSD-licenced** (3 clause):\r\n\r\n    This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.\r\n    OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2016, authors of MMVT\r\n    All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\r\n      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\r\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\r\n      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\r\n      and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n    * Neither the names of MMVT authors nor the names of any\r\n      contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\r\n      this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n    **This software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors\r\n    \"as is\" and any express or implied warranties, including, but not\r\n    limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\r\n    a particular purpose are disclaimed.
